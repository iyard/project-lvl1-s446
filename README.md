# About
Brain-games - This is my first experience of creating a project using git, packagist, travis and php.
The project contains simple text games.

# Installation
The easiest way to get started brain-games install using **composer** with the following command:
```
composer global require i-yard/brain-games:dev-master
```
Make sure you have the composer bin dir in your PATH. The default value is `~/.composer/vendor/bin/`, but you can check the value that you need to use by running `composer global config bin-dir --absolute`.
